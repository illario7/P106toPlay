Hello i am illario, i am programmer. 
I have changed the nvidia kernel driver 417.35,466.77,512.15
to make support all DirectX features,  such RayTracing by 
mining cards such as p106-090 and p106-100. 

My next target is to make these card work with pci-e version 3.0.
I have understanding where to find variables such pcilinkSpeed=1000
by disassembling code in Windows kernel debug mode.
